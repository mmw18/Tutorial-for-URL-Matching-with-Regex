# URL Matching with Regex

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

## Summary

This tutorial will specifically explore a Regex pattern used for matching URLs: `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`. This pattern combines various components, such as anchors, quantifiers, and character classes to correctly identify different parts of a URL. Each segment will be discussed for this, providing insight into how it validates protocols, domains, and paths.
